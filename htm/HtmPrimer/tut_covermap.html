<h1>Covermap</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="chegm"> 

Trixels</a> (I want to skip this, and jump to more <a class="el" href="../HtmExamples/tinydisk.html">EXAMPLES</a> with pictures). </h2>
 <p>
 A set of trixels that covers a region is called a covermap.
 Trixels that are completely inside
 are called "full" (shown with a salmon-red outline) and the rest are called "partial"</p>

<br />
 </center>
<p> The computation of a covermap was designed so that the number of <a href="tut_htm.html#HtmID">HtmID</a> ranges are 
within a range of numbers. In the above two examples, the number of triangles that cover both the large and small
circle are between 10 and 20.
We'll explain what "HtmID range"
means. In the large covermap, the two trixels with the lowest and highest HtmID's are each marked
with a yellow dot. On the smaller covermap, the trixels are also smaller, and so the names, and HtmID's
have more digits in them. So, one trick to compare apples to apples is to normalize the HtmIDs
to a fixed level, and recast each trixel as a range of <a href="tut_htm.html#HtmID">HtmID</a>'s at that given level.
In our case, that would be level 20 for practical considerations. In our example the two covermaps
have several triangles, the highest and lowest IDs and the ranges of level 20 IDs are in the table below

<p>
The first two belong to the large circle, the last two to the small circle.
You may note, that bringing these ID to a range of level 20 IDs (start, end values) keeps the
numbers in the same order of magnitude.
So how we represent a <em>covermap</em> is by the list of (start,end) value pairs of ID ranges
that represents each trixel. To make matters even more favorable, this scheme allows trivial
compression of this representation, because very often (though not everywhere) trixels near each other have similar IDs.
The convenient upshot of this is, that if two consecutive (start, end) ranges follow one
another without any gaps in the numbers, they can be represented as a single range of (start, end) values.
In particular, the 16 trixels in the large covermap can bre represented by only 9 ranges.
</p>
<p>Let's look at a specific example. Assume, that there is a table-valued function called
'fHtmCoverRegion' that returns a table of (start, end) values when given a region specification
using the language described by the <a href="regiongrammar.html">Region Specification Language</a>.
The circle's center is at
<blockquote>Lat=+39.3008, Lon=-76.610616 </blockquote>
with a 30 arc-minute (roughly 30 mile) radius. Then the table is computed by the following select
statement </p>
(we make no distinction between full and partial trixels here, as that information is lost).
<div class="fragment">
<pre class="fragment">select * from dbo.fHtmCoverRegion('CIRCLE LATLON 39.3008 -76.610616 30') 
HtmIDStart           HtmIDEnd

(9 row(s) affected) </pre></div> 
Note, that there are only 9 rows representing 16 trixels, as some adjacent ranges have 
been merged into one. There are other functions that will allow the treatment
of full and partial trixels, but that's beyond the scope of this primer. I will say that, in
the above example,
the reason for the  covermap of fully contained trixels in (c) looks different from those
is (a), is that the algorithm for providing the best cover is based on a constraint
that  limits the number of rows (HtmID start-end ranges). Since only full trixels
are of interest in computing (c), more room is available for the covermap, hence the
greater resolution of the full (salmon-colored) trixesl.
