MySkyServer Setup

This is a series of NSIS scripts used to generate an installer
for MySkyServer.  

The root script is skyserver.nsi.  These scripts are made and 
run using HM NIS.  

Because of size converns, the two main datafiles are left out of 
this module.  They are nearly the same as the orginal MySkyServer data files, 
except for the top few root directories are removed.  They should be named 
the following and should follow this structure...


MySkyServerDB.zip
/MySkyServerDB/
/MySkyServerDB/MyBestDR5_Data.MDF
/MySkyServerDB/HTM_V2_R56/
...etc

MySkyServerWI.zip
/MySkyServerWI/
/MySkyServerWI/Services
/MySkyServerWI/images
/MySkyServerWI/en
..etc


that should do it...
